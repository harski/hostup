HOSTUP
======

hostup is a program for tracking if remote hosts are up. The check is based on
pinging each host.


USAGE
-----

When running normally, the hostup doesn't ouput anything to stdout. Instead, it
prints everything to its logfile.

Running the program is straightforward:

    hostup
    hostup -l /path/to/log_file -c /path/to/config_file

If log file is not supplied, it defaults to $HOME/.hostup.log. If config file
is not supplied, it defaults to $HOME/.hostup.conf.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Configuration file must consist of list of hosts to be tracked, each on
separate lines. Blank lines are allowed, and if a line has the character '#'
everything after it is treated as a comment rather than a configuration option.

Host definition starts with the word host, follwed by the name of the host and
its IP-address. Each are separated by either space or tab. Everything after the
character '#' is treated as a comment. For example:

    host mylaptop 192.168.0.14 # The $BRAND laptop

    # The web server
    host myserver 62.78.2.11 # machine.example.com

    host desktop 192.168,0,2
